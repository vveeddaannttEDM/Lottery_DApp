# Lottery DApp

## Overview

The Lottery DApp is a decentralized application that enables users to participate in a blockchain-based lottery system. Leveraging the transparency and security of blockchain technology, this application ensures a fair and tamper-proof lottery experience.

## Features

- **Decentralized Lottery System**: Users can enter lottery rounds with confidence, knowing that the process is governed by smart contracts on the blockchain, eliminating the need for intermediaries.

- **Transparent Operations**: All transactions and lottery operations are recorded on the blockchain, providing participants with full transparency and auditability.

- **Secure and Fair Draws**: The use of smart contracts ensures that lottery draws are conducted fairly and results cannot be manipulated.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: The JavaScript runtime environment.

- **npm**: Node package manager, typically installed alongside Node.js.

- **Ganache**: A personal Ethereum blockchain for local development and testing.

- **Truffle**: A development framework for Ethereum smart contracts.

- **MetaMask**: A browser extension for managing Ethereum wallets and interacting with DApps.
